### __Introduction__
In computer science a lot of data is encoded to be used efficiently,
to be avle to give instructions to a computer to carry out information must be passed as bits (i.e 1's and 0's).
 So, movies, Video games, photographs, text and more are encoded as strigs of bits in a computer,
 and when dealing with those strings computers execute billions of instructions per second (a movie depending on the
 quality nd size can be billions of bits of data).
 So an effiecient method for comprition is needed to encode data without losing information
